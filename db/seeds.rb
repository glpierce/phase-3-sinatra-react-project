            description: "At the tender age of twenty-four, Lou Gehrig decided to tell the remarkable story of his life and career. He was one of the most famous athletes in the country, in the midst of a record-breaking season with the legendary 1927 World Series-winning Yankees. In an effort to grow Lou‚Äôs star, pioneering sports agent Christy Walsh arranged for Lou‚Äôs tale of baseball greatness to syndicate in newspapers across the country. Until now, those columns were largely forgotten and lost to history.\n\nLou comes alive in this inspiring memoir. It is a heartfelt rags-to-riches tale about a dirt poor kid from New York who became one of the most revered baseball players of all time.\n\nFourteen years after his account, Lou would tragically die from ALS, a neuromuscular disorder now known as Lou Gehrig‚Äôs Disease. His poignant autobiography is followed by an insightful biographical essay by historian Alan D. Gaff. Here is Lou‚ÄîHall of Famer, All Star, and MVP‚Äîback at bat.",

Brought up in a well-to-do upper-middle-class family, who had sent her to Cambridge and the Sorbonne and hoped that she would go into law, the young woman defied their wishes and set her sights on being an artist. Her introduction to Picasso led to a friendship, a love affair, and a relationship of ten years, during which Gilot gave birth to Picasso‚Äôs two children, Paloma and Claude. Gilot was one of Picasso‚Äôs muses; she was also very much her own woman, determined to make herself into the remarkable painter she did indeed become.",
